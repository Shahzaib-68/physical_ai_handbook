# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`
**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently

  REMEMBER: For Physical AI book, focus on browser-first, hands-on experiences
  that are accessible to beginners and intermediate developers
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language focused on browser-based, hands-on experience]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently as a browser-based experience - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value] in the browser in under 2 minutes"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial browser state], **When** [user action in browser], **Then** [expected outcome in browser]
2. **Given** [initial browser state], **When** [user action in browser], **Then** [expected outcome in browser]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language focused on browser-based, hands-on experience]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently as a browser-based experience]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial browser state], **When** [user action in browser], **Then** [expected outcome in browser]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language focused on browser-based, hands-on experience]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently as a browser-based experience]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial browser state], **When** [user action in browser], **Then** [expected outcome in browser]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases, keeping in mind browser-first experience.
-->

- What happens when [browser compatibility issue]?
- How does system handle [browser limitation]?
- What if [user has accessibility needs]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements, aligning with the constitution:
  - Browser-first experience (everything runs in browser <2 mins)
  - Hands-on mastery (interactive examples)
  - Inclusive accessibility (Hinglish + emojis)
  - Progressive learning
  - Real-world relevance
  - Community-driven growth
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Feature MUST run in browser without installation in under 2 minutes
- **FR-002**: Feature MUST provide hands-on interactive example for the concept
- **FR-003**: Feature MUST use casual Hinglish English with emojis for accessibility
- **FR-004**: Feature MUST build on previous concepts in progressive learning approach
- **FR-005**: Feature MUST demonstrate real-world relevance with practical application

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-006**: Feature MUST be accessible via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: browser compatibility requirements not specified]
- **FR-007**: Feature MUST perform within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: performance requirements for browser not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation, considering browser constraints]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities, considering browser constraints]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
  Align with browser-first, hands-on, accessible principles of the constitution.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Browser-based metric, e.g., "Users can run example in browser in under 2 minutes"]
- **SC-002**: [Hands-on engagement metric, e.g., "Users can modify and experiment with examples immediately"]
- **SC-003**: [Accessibility metric, e.g., "90% of users understand concept without technical jargon"]
- **SC-004**: [Learning progression metric, e.g., "Users can build on previous concepts successfully"]
