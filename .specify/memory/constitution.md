## Vision
Make physical AI accessible to everyone with hands-on projects that run instantly in your browser! 🚀

## Who This Book Is For
Absolute beginners to intermediate learners - from school kids curious about robots to college students and self-taught developers exploring physical AI without complex theory. Come join the fun! 🌟

## 6 Core Principles
1. **Hands-On Vibes Only** 🛠️ - No theory without practice! Every concept has a fun browser project.
2. **Zero Setup Maza** 🎉 - Everything runs in browser, no installations, just pure coding fun from the start.
3. **Quick Wins** 🏆 - Every project runs in under 2 minutes for instant learning gratification.
4. **Chill & Learn** 🧘‍♂️ - Friendly approachable language, no corporate stiffness.
5. **Make It Yours** 🎨 - Customize and experiment with every project to make it your own.
6. **Community Powered** 🤝 - Share, help, and learn together as builders and dreamers.

## Success Looks Like
Learners building physics sims and robot controllers in weeks, not months! Students sharing projects online with excitement, creating a community of makers not afraid to experiment. Real success = smiles during coding and "aha" moments! 📈🎯

## Hard Rules
- Every chapter has a working browser project
- No chapter >10 mins to implement
- Zero local setup requirements
- Every project has "make it your own" challenge
- Each concept has visual demonstration
