# Chapter 3: Dynamics - Forces & Motion 🚀

Coming soon! In this chapter, we'll explore dynamics, which describes how forces affect motion. This is where we go beyond just describing motion and start understanding what causes it.

## What You'll Learn:
- How forces affect acceleration (F=ma)
- Torque and rotational motion
- How robots apply forces to manipulate objects
- Simulating physics in virtual environments

## Key Concepts:
- Newton's laws of motion
- Force, mass, and acceleration relationships
- Moments and torques
- Friction and contact forces

## Coming Up Next:
We'll build on our kinematics knowledge to create more realistic simulations that account for forces and their effects on motion.

Stay tuned for interactive demos that will help you understand how forces create the motion we see in robots and physical systems!
