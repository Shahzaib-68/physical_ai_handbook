# Physical AI – Hands-On Book for Everyone

Welcome to the Physical AI interactive textbook! This project aims to make robotics and physical AI accessible to everyone through browser-based interactive demos.

## 🚀 Features

- **100% Browser-Based**: No installations required - everything runs in your browser
- **Interactive Demos**: Each chapter includes hands-on simulations you can modify and experiment with
- **Progressive Learning**: Concepts build upon each other for a smooth learning experience
- **Hinglish & Emojis**: Approachable language with cultural context
- **Zero Setup**: Run any demo in under 2 minutes

## 📚 Book Structure

This book consists of 10 chapters covering fundamental concepts in Physical AI:

1. **Introduction to Physical AI**: First steps with interactive physics simulations
2. **Kinematics Fundamentals**: Understanding motion in Physical AI
3. **Dynamics - Forces & Motion**: How forces affect movement
4. **Sensors**: How robots perceive their environment
5. **Control Systems**: Making robots do what you want
6. **Motion Planning**: Navigating through space
7. **Learning in Physical Systems**: AI for robotics
8. **Robot Vision**: Understanding the visual world
9. **Manipulation**: Grasping and moving objects
10. **Humanoid Robots**: Bringing it all together
